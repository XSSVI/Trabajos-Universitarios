          <strong>Slayer</strong> is a recurring character in the Guilty Gear series. A refined vampiric gentleman most often accompanied by his wife Sharon, Slayer enjoys "meddling" in others' affairs, offering unwanted advice to those he encounters. The founder of the Assassin's Guild, his manners belie monstrous strength that only few can match.

            <li>Slayer's general appearance is that of a middle-aged man to whom fine clothing is of importance: he wears a two-part gray suit above a white dress shirt with long pointy tails, held at the waist by a cummerbund and sporting a horizontal, red-with-white-piping bar across his chest. A necktie neatly knotted at the throat rests on top; both with flowered ends, they give the appearance of a Latin cross of the cross fleury style. His unbuttoned single-breasted suit jacket bears matching cross-shaped textiles on the sleeves, possesses swallow-styled tails, and is adorned with belt buckles below its peaked lapels. Over his right shoulder is an elbow-length red cape that can shapeshift for a variety of uses. He completes his ensemble with light-brown dress shoes.</li>

            <li>In Strive, Slayer changes his jacket for a double-breasted black waistcoat with pinstripes and silver buttons, its right lapel adorned with a golden apple-shaped badge and chain that has the word "Dandyism" engraved onto it. Below the waistcoat, his dress shirt has a white body and collar—adorned with a simple, dark red tie—but black sleeves. Slayer also wears a black greatcoat with standing lapels, its inner lining red, over his shoulders like a cape; much like before, red-and-white flower-ended horizonal bar and crosses are embroidered onto the coat's chest and sleeves, respectively. His shoes and suit trousers remain unchanged, but now a golden pocket watch is secured to one of his belt loops.</li>

            <li>Slayer has brown eyes and hair, usually slicked to the side, complemented by a short well-kept beard and a thin moustache. He wears a monocle on his left eye, and is often found smoking a pipe even while in battle. Upon reverting to a more youthful self by drinking his opponent's blood, Slayer loses his mustache and his beard turns into a goatee.</li>
